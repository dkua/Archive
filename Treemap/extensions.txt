Extensions

1) Tkinter GUI
Created a simple setup menu in Tkinter that allows the user to visually
browse for the directory to treemap, select what window size they
choose, and whether they want the random or non-random colour scheme.
Errors pop up as dialogue boxes.

2) Non-random Colour Scheme
Created a function that generates random and non-random colour schemes
for the treemap. In the non-random mode, the files of a folder are all
different shades of a single colour, allowing for easier recognition of
folders.

3) Click-to-Open Functionality
Created a function that uses Pygame's mouse events and the sys, os, and
subprocess Python modules to open the containing folder of whatever 
file rectangle the user clicks on. Currently only works on Windows and
OSX systems.
4) Squarified tiling algorithm. Display only.
