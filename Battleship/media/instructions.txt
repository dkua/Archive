Welcome to our implementation of the battleship game.
Please follow the prompts to set up the game correctly.
Each player is given a square board of n size. (n x n)
The board must be at least n = 2.
The user may choose any number of ships to place on the boards.
As long as they have a minimum total ship length of 2.
There are four kinds of ships:
Destroyer (DEST) - Length of 2
Submarine (SUBM) - Length of 3
Battleship (BATT) - Length of 4
Carrier (CARR) - Length of 5
The players' may choose to manually place their own ships.
They may also choose to let the game randomly place them.
A quick game is random placement of 1 DEST, 2 SUBM, 1 BATT, and 1 CARR.
Once game is setup all the player needs to do is input an x and y co-ordinate.
The first player to have all their ships hit/sunk loses.
That's pretty much it for rules.
Oh, type quit() at anytime to exit the program.
Or type start_menu() to go back to the main menu.
Enjoy our game!
